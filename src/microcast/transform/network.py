"""Silver -> gold.network_features: PurpleAir transect features per HRRR cycle.

The transect's sensors read hot inside their housings, so levels are never
used, only changes (D10): each sensor's last-hour and 3-hour change, and its
anomaly against its own trailing 14-day mean at the same hour of day (which
also removes most of the daytime solar heating). Two transect summaries: the
mean anomaly, and west minus east (Ocean Beach side vs Castro side, split at
the median longitude), which is the marine-layer push in one number.

As-of rule: PurpleAir hourly averages are stamped with the start of the hour,
so the last hour complete at a cycle's init is the one starting an hour
earlier. That is visible well before the issue time (init + 55 min).
