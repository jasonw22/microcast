# microcast

An experiment to use backyard sensors and public weather data to forecast SF microclimates. Mostly an excuse to play with data pipelines and weather models. 

Hyperlocal weather forecasts for a handful of named places and routes in San
Francisco. Microcast ingests hourly NWP runs (HRRR first; RRFS, REFS and GFS
later) and neighborhood sensors, learns each model's local error, and turns
the result into plain-language alerts ("the marine layer reaches the house
around 5 pm", "leave by 1:30 for a tailwind home for a bike ride to the ocean").

The forecasts are just a test case. The thing I want to build/play with is the platform: raw data →
Iceberg lake → features → competing models → backtests → live inference, all
reproducible.

- [Design doc](docs/design.md): the original design.
- [Decisions](docs/decisions.md): changes since then, numbered D1–D12 (the
  "D" ids cited below). These take precedence over the design doc.
- [Phase 1 spec](docs/specs/phase-1.md): what's built and what's next.

## What exists today vs. what's planned

The [design doc](docs/design.md) describes the full system. Most of it is not
built yet. As of 2026-10-06:

**Built and running on a laptop (phase 1)**

- A registry of places, routes and truth stations, turned into ~27 virtual
  forecast points (`config/places.yaml`).
- A local Iceberg lake (PyIceberg with a SQLite catalog, Parquet files under
  `./data`) with bronze, silver and gold layers, queried through DuckDB.
- Ingest from nine working data sources (table below) into the lake's bronze layer.
- Terrain features for every point (USGS 3DEP 10 m elevation, HRRR's own
  terrain height, slope, shelter, fetch from the water) in
  `silver.static_features`.
- Seven models behind one interface: raw HRRR, a rolling-bias correction, a
  LightGBM residual model, the same LightGBM with the PurpleAir transect
  (1–2% better on temperature, no help on gust), with terrain in place of the
  station id (as good on known stations, 4–5 points better on unseen ones),
  and two HRRR-only variants for places with no station of their own.
- Backtests on rolling monthly folds with CRPS skill and bootstrap CIs, logged
  to MLflow (SQLite file). **The phase 1 gate is passed:** at the four original stations
  the GBM residual beats raw HRRR at 0–6 h by about 30–43% for temperature
  and 27–30% for gust, and it now trains and scores at 36 stations including
  the Castro and Golden Gate Park
  ([results](docs/specs/phase-1.md#results-with-the-network-stations-2026-10-06)).
- Leave-stations-out backtests (`microcast backtest --holdout`): how the
  models do at a station they never trained on
  ([results](docs/specs/phase-1.md#terrain-and-leave-stations-out-2026-10-06-evening)).
- A benchmark against NWS's National Blend of Models (NBM) on the same rows
  (`microcast backtest --nbm`): at 1–6 h NBM is only 2–6% better than raw
  HRRR at these stations; ours is 35–55% better
  ([results](docs/specs/phase-1.md#nbm-benchmark-2026-10-12)).
- A first look at crosswind gust on the Golden Gate Bridge from GGBC1, the
  station mid-span (its mirrored wind vane is corrected in silver)
  ([results](docs/specs/phase-1.md#golden-gate-bridge-crosswind-2026-10-06-evening)).
- A static status site (Status and Analytics pages) built from the lake; it
  runs locally, not hosted yet.

**Data sources that work today**

| Source | What it gives us | Stations / coverage | How it's pulled | State |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| HRRR via Herbie (NOAA on AWS) | Forecast fields (temperature, dewpoint, wind, gust, rain, visibility, sunlight, cloud) at our points | ~27 registry points around SF | `microcast ingest nwp` (live GRIB; the newest run, ~1 h after its start) | Works; run by hand |
| HRRR history (University of Utah hrrrzarr archive) | The same fields for past cycles, up to 18 h ahead | Hourly cycles 2025-04 → now (~13,000; 124 missing in the archive), at the registry points and 42 network stations. Each cycle's Bay Area window is kept on disk (2.4 GB), so a new point inside it needs no download | `microcast backfill hrrr` (`--points network` for the stations) | Loaded; the archive runs ~3 h behind real time |
| NBM via Herbie (NOAA on AWS) | National Blend of Models: temperature and gust, mean and ensemble spread, as a benchmark only | The backtest stations; one run a day (rotating hour) 2025-07 → 2026-10-05 | `microcast backfill nbm` | Loaded (462 runs) |
| IEM ASOS | Airport observations: temperature, dewpoint, wind, gust | KSFO (SFO), KOAK (Oakland) | `microcast ingest obs` | Loaded 2025-04 → now |
| IEM HADS | Hourly temperature | SFOC1 (the Mint, downtown SF; the house's stand-in) | `microcast ingest obs` | Loaded 2025-04 → now |
| NDBC | Temperature, wind, gust | FTPC1 (Fort Point, Golden Gate) | `microcast ingest obs` | Loaded 2025-04 → now |
| Synoptic | Temperature, wind, gust, solar radiation | 604PG (PG&E, Golden Gate Park) and five CWOP home stations in the Castro | `microcast ingest synoptic` | Works; free tier keeps 7 days, so it accrues from 2026-09-28 |
| MADIS mesonet archive | History for the same Synoptic stations plus ~25 more in the SF box (CWOP, PG&E, Presidio, Marin headlands) | 2025-04 → now | `microcast backfill madis` | Loaded (18.8M rows) |
| PurpleAir, own sensor | PM2.5 on both laser channels, sensor temperature, humidity, pressure | The outdoor PA-II at the house | `microcast ingest purpleair` (home network, free) | Works; run by hand |
| PurpleAir, public transect | Hourly sensor temperature | 10 public sensors, Ocean Beach → Sunset → Twin Peaks → Castro, 2025-04 → now | `microcast backfill purpleair` (paid API points) | Loaded (~115k rows; ~237k API points) |

The backtest trains and scores at 36 stations: the four original truth
stations (SFOC1, KSFO, KOAK, FTPC1) plus the MADIS network, which includes
the Synoptic stations. The PurpleAir sensors are inputs to one model, never truth
(their temperature reads hot).

**Planned, not built**

- Dagster OSS as the scheduler and backfill engine, on the home k3s cluster,
  with Postgres for Dagster and the Iceberg catalog
  ([D12](docs/decisions.md#d12--dagster-on-k3s-runs-the-collectors-not-cronjobs)).
  Until then, every collector is run by hand.
- MinIO/S3 storage and the Lakekeeper REST catalog.
- Hourly live PurpleAir polling (D10).
- A backyard weather station at the house (D5).
- Hosting the status site at weather.henry.st (D8).
- Live inference, the forecast panel on the site, and plain-language alerts
  to Slack.
- More NWP models (RRFS, REFS, GFS), and cloud-cover forecasts.

The [phase 1 spec](docs/specs/phase-1.md) has the running checklist and the
ordered next steps.

## Quick start

```sh
uv sync --all-extras
cp .env.example .env          # set MICROCAST_HOME_LAT / _LON, PurpleAir index
uv run pytest
uv run microcast points       # registry virtual points
uv run microcast lake init    # local Iceberg catalog under ./data
uv run microcast ingest nwp hrrr --init latest-3 --leads 0-6
uv run microcast lake snapshots bronze.nwp_point
```

Phase 1 end to end (history → backtest → status site):

```sh
uv run microcast ingest obs --start 2025-04-01            # station truth, no keys needed
uv run microcast backfill hrrr --start 2025-04-01 --end 2026-10-01   # hourly cycles, resumable
uv run microcast backfill madis --start 2025-04-01 --end 2026-10-01  # network stations' history
uv run microcast backfill hrrr --start 2025-04-01 --end 2026-10-01 --points network --tag net1
uv run microcast build silver && uv run microcast build gold        # gold: 36 truth stations
uv run microcast build static                             # terrain per point (fetches 3DEP once)
uv run microcast backtest                                 # -> gold.scores, MLflow, data/reports/
uv run microcast backtest --holdout --models gbm_residual,gbm_terrain,gbm_nwp,gbm_nwp_terrain  # leave stations out
uv run microcast backfill nbm --end 2026-10-06            # NBM benchmark runs, one a day
uv run microcast backtest --nbm --models bias_rolling,gbm_terrain  # NBM on the backtest's rows
uv run microcast compare                                  # leaderboard vs raw HRRR
uv run microcast site --out site                          # static pages for weather.henry.st
python -m http.server -d site 8000
```

Collectors, run by hand until Dagster schedules them (D12): `microcast ingest
synoptic` (at least weekly; the free tier keeps only 7 days), `microcast ingest
purpleair` (every 2 min on the home network). MADIS history: `microcast
backfill madis --start 2025-04-01` (resumable; streams ~30 MB per hour of data
and keeps the SF box). PurpleAir transect history: `microcast backfill
purpleair` (spends API points, stops at `--floor`), then `--load` into bronze. To move the lake to the cluster: `microcast lake copy --to <catalog>`,
then rebuild silver and gold there (decisions D11).

Each ingest batch appends new Parquet files and a new Iceberg snapshot to
`bronze`, which is append-only. Silver and gold rebuild whole partitions into
fewer, larger files. To move from local disk to Lakekeeper and S3/MinIO, set
the `PYICEBERG_CATALOG__MICROCAST__*` variables; no code changes.
